Multi-Client Project

I have been collecting and working with the embedded Linux cards from Technologic Systems
https://www.embeddedts.com/products/single-board-computers 
over the years and the great thing about these cards is they have a PC-104 interface. I also 
found on ebay a number of PC-104 daughter cards, each with 20 io ports. Depending on the jumper 
configuration, these cards can be addressed at 4 different locations in the address space. 
I used them for my home automation system using a sockets client/server model. One card (with 
the io daughter card) is the sockets server and all the rest are clients. One of the clients is 
running on a windows PC and is the monitor used mostly to turn on/off lights in the cabin and 
the garage.
