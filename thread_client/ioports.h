(from manual: https://wiki.embeddedarm.com/wiki/TS-7800#DIO_Header)

Access to the DIO header is described here. These pins can be driven low, otherwise they are inputs
with pull-up resistors. The pull-ups are via 2.2k Ohms on the odd numbered pins 1-15. Pin 10 has a
4.7k pull-up and is a read-only input. The rest are pulled up by the CPLD through 20k-150k nominal
resistance. The pinout for the DIO header is shown below.

There is no built-in SPI bus on the TS-7800, but SPI is easily implemented in software as
demonstrated in our sample code.

Although the distinction is transparent to the user, the most of the pins on the DIO and LCD headers are driven by CPLD, which means that they are 5V tolerant. However logic levels of 0-3.3V are still recommended. Applying 5V to a pin that is connected to the CPLD before it has been initialized may damage the CPLD. The only pins that come directly from the FPGA are output pins for the SPI bus. The SPI_MISO pin goes through a separate buffer chip to get to the FPGA so it is also 5V tolerant.

The DIO and LCD headers are controlled by 32 bit registers at 0xe8000004 and 0xe8000008. Bits 15-0 control the DIO header and bits 29-16 control the LCD header. The register at 0xe8000008 is the output register. Writing a 0 drives the pin low but writing a 1 only tri-states. To use these pins for input, write a 1 to the output register and read the register at 0xe8000004. See the #LCD Header and #DIO Header sections for more details.

PC104 on TS-7800: (from 6.2.5 in manual)

To access peripherals on the PC104 bus it is necessary to add the base address from the table below to the offset of the peripheral to get a memory address for accessing the peripheral. For example, for ISA 8-bit I/O address 0x100, add 0xEE000000 to 0x100 to get 0xEE000100.

		Memory		I/O
8-bit 	0xEC000000 	0xEE000000
16-bit 	0xED000000 	0xEF000000

IRQs 5, 6, and 7 on the PC104 bus from the TS-7800 are 64 + the PC104 IRQ number. These will be IRQs 69, 70, and 71.


the following is for the TS-7200

DIO lines DIO_0 thru DIO_7 = 0x8084_0004.
The DDR for this port is at address location 0x8084_0014.
DIO_8 is accessed via bit 1 of Port F in the EP9302. The Port F data register is at address
location 0x8084_0030. The DDR address for this port is location 0x8084_0034.
The Pin 4 of the DIO1 Header, in the default configuration, is accessed via bit 0 of Port C
in the EP9302. The address location 0x8084_0008 is Port C Data Register and
0x8084_0018 is Port C Directon Register.
When accessing these registers, it is important not to change the other bit positions in
these Port F registers. Other DIO1 Port functionality, used for dedicated TS-7200
functions, utilize these same control registers. All accesses to these registers should use
read-modify-write cycles.
Warning
All pins on the DIO header use 0-3.3V logic levels. Do not drive these lines to 5V.
When the DIO pins are configured as outputs, they can “source” 4 mA or “sink” 8 mA and
have logic swings between GND and 3.3V. When configured as inputs, they have
standard TTL level thresholds and must not be driven below 0 Volts or above 3.3 Volts.
DIO lines DIO_0 thru DIO_3 have 4.7K Ohm “pull-up” resistors to 3.3V biasing these
signals to a logic”1”. The other DIO pins have 100K Ohm bias resistors biasing these
inputs to a logic “1”.
SPI Interface
The EP9302 Synchronous Serial Port is available on the DIO1 header. This port can
implement either a master or slave interface to peripheral devices that have either
Motorola SPI, or National Semiconductor Microwire serial interfaces.
The transmit and receive data paths are buffered with internal FIFO memories allowing up
to eight 16-bit values to be stored for both transmit and receive modes. The clock rate is
programmable up to 3.7 MHz and has programmable phase and polarity. The data frame
size is programmable from 4 to 16 bits.
By using some of the DIO1 Header pins as peripheral Chip Select signals, a complete
interface is available for addressing up to 9 SPI peripherals. The SPI bus pins are defined
in the table below:
